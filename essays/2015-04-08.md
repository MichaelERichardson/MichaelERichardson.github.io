## Summary

This report is to show what hardware & software will improve the courier service. First I will start by showing a list of the Standard Equipment: Office Systems, Mobile Systems, Networking Equipment, and Specialized Software.  Then I will show you three Server Options that I think will meets the needs of the business. 
The server options have been divided into three groups. The first option is a custom built system. This option will have the greatest amount of flexibility. Second on the list is an Off the Shelf server. This will save you some on labor cost and time, over the first option. The third option is to use a server service. The best thing about this option is that they take care of most of the maintenance for you.
I recommend that you start out with the web based server service. As it has low maintenance and it costs the least to get up and running. As the business grows I also recommend that you look into getting your own servers.
